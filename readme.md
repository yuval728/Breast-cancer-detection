# Breast Cancer Detection
This project focuses on breast cancer detection using machine learning techniques. The primary tools used in this project are Pandas, Scikit-learn, and MLflow.

## Project Structure

This project focuses on breast cancer detection using machine learning techniques. The primary tools used in this project are Pandas, Scikit-learn, MLflow, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Structure

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Breat_cancer_data.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- MLflow
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-detection.git
    cd breast-cancer-detection
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas scikit-learn mlflow matplotlib seaborn
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Notebook**:
    - Execute the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.
    - Example:
        ```sh
        jupyter notebook main.ipynb
        ```

2. **MLflow Tracking**:
    - Track experiments and models using MLflow.
    - Example:
        ```sh
        mlflow ui
        ```
